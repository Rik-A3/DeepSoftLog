The autonomous state of <mask> has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed republics. Since 1992, the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at Antananarivo. However, in a popular uprising in 2009, president Marc Raval<mask>ana was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in March 2009 to Andry Rajoelina.

Malagasy and French are both official languages of the state. The majority of the population adheres to traditional beliefs, Christianity, or an amalgamation of both. Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health, and private enterprise, are key elements of <mask>'s development strategy. Under Raval<mask>ana, these investments produced substantial economic growth, but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class.

It is bordered by <mask> to the west, the Gulf of Aden to the north, the Guardafui Channel and So<mask> Sea to the east, and <mask> to the southwest. <mask> has the longest coastline on Africa's mainland, and its terrain consists mainly of plateaus, plains and highlands. Climatically, hot conditions prevail year-round, with periodic monsoon winds and irregular rainfall.<mask> has an estimated population of around 14.3 million., and has been described as the most culturally homogeneous country in Africa. Around 85% of its residents are ethnic So<mask>s, who have historically inhabited the northern part of the country. Ethnic minorities are largely concentrated in the southern regions. The official languages of are So<mask> and Arabic. Most people in the country are Muslim, with the majority being Sunni.In antiquity, <mask> was an important commercial centre. It is among the most probable locations of the fabled ancient Land of Punt. During the Middle Ages, several powerful So<mask> empires dominated the regional trade, including the Ajuran Empire, the Adal Sultanate, the Warsangali Sultanate, and the Sultanate of the Geledi. The toponym <mask> was coined by the Italian explorer Luigi Robecchi Bricchetti (1855–1926).In the late 19th century, the British and Italian empires established the colonies of British So<mask>land and Italian So<mask>land. In the interior, Mohammed Abdullah Hassan's Darwiish repelled the British four times, forcing a retreat to the coast, before succumbing in the So<mask>land campaign (1920). <mask> acquired full control of the northeastern, central and southern parts of the area after successfully waging the Campaign of the Sultanates against the ruling Majeerteen Sultanate and Sultanate of Hobyo. In 1960, the two regions united to form the independent So<mask> Republic under a civilian government.The Supreme Revolutionary Council seized power in 1969 and established the So<mask> Democratic Republic, which collapsed in 1991 as the So<mask> Civil War broke out. During this period most regions returned to customary and religious law. The early 2000s saw the creation of interim federal administrations. The Transitional National Government (TNG) was established in 2000, followed by the formation of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in 2004, which reestablished the military. In 2006, the TFG assumed control of most of the nation's southern conflict zones from the newly formed Islamic Courts Union (ICU). The ICU subsequently splintered into more radical groups such as Al-Shabaab, which battled the TFG and its AMISOM allies for control of the region.By mid-2012, the insurgents had lost most of the territory that they had seized, and a search for more permanent democratic institutions began. A new provisional constitution was passed in August 2012, which reformed <mask> as a federation. The same month, the Federal Government of <mask> was formed and a period of reconstruction began in Mogadishu. <mask> has maintained an informal economy, mainly based on livestock, remittances from So<mask>s working abroad, and telecommunications.

It has land borders with <mask> to the north, <mask> to the northeast, <mask> on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and <mask> to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. <mask>'s economic and technological center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over Jerusalem has only partial recognition.<mask> has evidence of the earliest migration of hominids out of Africa. Canaanite tribes are archaeologically attested since the Middle Bronze Age, while the Kingdoms of <mask> and Judah emerged during the Iron Age. The Neo-As<mask>n Empire destroyed <mask> around 720 BCE. Judah was later conquered by the Babylonian, Persian and Hellenistic empires and had existed as Jewish autonomous provinces. The successful Maccabean Revolt led to an independent Hasmonean kingdom by 110 BCE, which in 63 BCE however became a client state of the R<mask> Republic that subsequently installed the Herodian dynasty in 37 BCE, and in 6 CE created the R<mask> province of Judea. Judea lasted as a R<mask> province until the failed Jewish revolts resulted in widespread destruction, the expulsion of the Jewish population and the renaming of the region from Iudaea to <mask> Palaestina. Jewish presence in the region has persisted to a certain extent over the centuries. In the 7th century CE, the Levant was taken from the Byzantine Empire by the Arabs and remained in Muslim control until the First Crusade of 1099, followed by the Ayyubid conquest of 1187. The Mamluk Sultanate of <mask> extended its control over the Levant in the 13th century until its defeat by the Ott<mask> Empire in 1517.

The capital and largest city is Reykjavík, with Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country being home to over two-thirds of the population. <mask> is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains, and glaciers, and many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. <mask> is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.The word "Ísland/Island" in Nordic languages is literally translated to English as its name "<mask>" and should not be confused with the word island.According to the ancient manuscript Landnámabók, the settlement of <mask> began in 874 AD when the Norwegian chieftain Ingólfr Arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island. In the following centuries, Norwegians, and to a lesser extent other Scandinavians, emigrated to <mask>, bringing with them thralls (i.e., slaves or serfs) of Gaelic origin.The island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the Althing, one of the world's oldest functioning legislative assemblies. Following a period of civil strife, <mask> acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century. The establishment of the Kalmar Union in 1397 united the kingdoms of <mask>, <mask>, and <mask>. <mask> thus followed <mask>'s integration into that union, coming under Danish rule after <mask>'s secession from the union in 1523. Although the Danish kingdom introduced Lutheranism forcefully in 1550, <mask> remained a distant semi-colonial territory in which Danish institutions and infrastructures were conspicuous by their absence.In the wake of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, <mask>'s struggle for independence took form and culminated in independence in 1918 and the founding of a republic in 1944.  Although its parliament (Althing) was suspended from 1799 to 1845, the island republic has been credited with sustaining the world's oldest and longest-running parliament.Until the 20th century, <mask> relied largely on subsistence fishing and agriculture. Industrialisation of the fisheries and Marshall Plan aid following World War II brought prosperity and <mask> became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world. In 1994, it became a part of the European Economic Area, which further diversified the economy into sectors such as finance, biotechnology, and manufacturing.<mask> has a market economy with relatively low taxes, compared to other OECD countries. It maintains a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens. <mask> ranks high in economic, democratic, social stability, and equality, currently ranking first in the world by median wealth per adult. In 2018, it was ranked as the sixth most developed country in the world by the United Nations' Human Development Index, and it ranks first on the Global Peace Index. <mask> runs almost completely on renewable energy.Hit hard by the worldwide financial crisis, the nation's entire banking system systemically failed in October 2008, leading to a severe depression, substantial political unrest, the Icesave dispute, and the institution of capital controls. Some bankers were jailed. Since then, the economy has made a significant recovery, in large part due to a surge in tourism. A law that took effect in 2018 makes it illegal in <mask> for women to be paid less than men.<mask>ic culture is founded upon the nation's Scandinavian heritage. Most <mask>ers are descendants of Norse and Gaelic settlers. <mask>ic, a North Germanic language, is descended from Old West Norse and is closely related to Faroese. The country's cultural heritage includes traditional <mask>ic cuisine, <mask>ic literature, and medieval sagas. <mask> has the smallest population of any NATO member and is the only one with no standing army, with a lightly armed coast guard.

In 1856, southern Bessarabia was returned to Moldavia, which three years later united with Wallachia to form R<mask>ia, but <mask>n rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878. During the 1917 <mask>n Revolution, Bessarabia briefly became an autonomous state within the <mask>n Republic, known as the Moldavian Democratic Republic. In February 1918, the Moldavian Democratic Republic declared independence and then integrated into R<mask>ia later that year following a vote of its assembly. The decision was disputed by Soviet <mask>, which in 1924 established, within the Ukrainian SSR, a Moldavian autonomous republic (MASSR) on partially <mask>n-inhabited territories to the east of Bessarabia. In 1940, as a consequence of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, R<mask>ia was compelled to cede Bessarabia to the Soviet Union, leading to the creation of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (Moldavian SSR), which included the greater part of Bessarabia and the westernmost strip of the former MASSR (east of the Dniester River).On 27 August 1991, as the dissolution of the Soviet Union was underway, the Moldavian SSR declared independence and took the name <mask>.

The capital and most populous city is San Juan. The territory's total population is approximately 3.4 million. Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government, though Spanish predominates.Originally populated by the indigenous Taíno people, <mask> was colonized by <mask> following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493. It was contested by the French, Dutch, and British, but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries. The island's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population, the forced migration of African slaves, and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia. In the Spanish Empire, <mask> played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like <mask> and New <mask>. <mask>'s distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century, producing a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined indigenous, African, and European elements. On September 23, 1868, Ramón Emeterio Betances unleashed a revolt against Spanish rule, declaring for the first time the idea of <mask> as a distinct people, with right to sovereignty. This revolt, known as El Grito de Lares, was eventually put down by Spanish forces, but the movement continued.

As it is not a state, <mask> does not have a vote in the <mask> Congress, which governs the territory with full jurisdiction under the <mask> Federal Relations Act of 1950. However, <mask> does have one non-voting member of the House called a Resident Commissioner.

Like other territories and the District of Columbia, <mask> does not have U.S. senators. Congress approved a local constitution in 1952, allowing U.S. citizens of the territory to elect a governor. <mask>'s future political status has consistently been a matter of significant debate.In early 2017, the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government. The outstanding bond debt had climbed to $70 billion at a time with 12.4% unemployment. The debt had been increasing during a decade long recession. This was the second major financial crisis to affect the island after the Great Depression when the U.S. government, in 1935, provided relief efforts through the <mask> Reconstruction Administration. On May 3, 2017, <mask>'s financial oversight board in the U.S. District Court for <mask> filed the debt restructuring petition which was made under Title III of PROMESA. By early August 2017, the debt was $72 billion with a 45% poverty rate.In late September 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall in <mask>, causing devastating damage. The island's electrical grid was largely destroyed, provoking the largest power outage in American history. Recovery efforts were slow in the first few months, and over 200,000 residents had moved to the mainland State of Florida alone by late November 2017.

In 275 CE, the region came under the rule of the later Jewish-influenced Himyarite Kingdom. Christianity arrived in the fourth century.

His rule has been described as a kleptocracy.Since 2011, <mask> has been in a state of political crisis starting with street protests against poverty, unemployment, corruption, and president Saleh's plan to amend <mask>'s constitution and eliminate the presidential term limit, in effect making him president for life. President Saleh stepped down and the powers of the presidency were transferred to Vice President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, who was formally elected president on 21 February 2012 in a one-man election. The total absence of central government during this transitional process engendered the escalation of the several clashes on-going in the country, like the armed conflict between the Houthi rebels of Ansar Allah militia and the al-Islah forces, as well as the al-Qaeda insurgency. In September 2014, the Houthis took over Sana'a with the help of the ousted president Saleh, later declaring themselves in control of the country after a coup d'état; Saleh was shot dead by a sniper in Sana'a in December 2017. This resulted in a new civil war and a <mask>n-led military intervention aimed at restoring Hadi's government. At least 56,000 civilians and combatants have been killed in armed violence in <mask> since January 2016.The conflict has resulted in a famine that is affecting 17 million people. The lack of safe drinking water, caused by depleted aquifers and the destruction of the country's water infrastructure, has also caused the largest, fastest-spreading cholera outbreak in modern history, with the number of suspected cases exceeding 994,751. Over 2,226 people have died since the outbreak began to spread rapidly at the end of April 2017.

Burial sites dating back to the Neolithic Age and the Bronze Age include the oldest known such inland site at Jebel Buhais. Known as Magan to the Sumerians, the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the Umm Al Nar period, which traded between the Indus Valley, <mask> and Mesopotamia as well as <mask>, Bactria and the Levant. The ensuing Wadi Suq period and three Iron Ages saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior. The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the Sasanians and the subsequent Battle of Dibba. The UAE's long history of trade led to the emergence of Julfar, in the present day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area. The maritime dominance of the Persian Gulf by Emirati traders led to conflicts with European powers, including the Portuguese and British.Following decades of maritime conflict, the coastal emirates became known as the Trucial States with the signing of a Perpetual Treaty of Maritime Peace with the British in 1819 (ratified in 1853 and again in 1892), which established the Trucial States as a British Protectorate.

Six emirates joined the UAE in 1971, the seventh, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the federation on 10 February 1972.Islam is the official religion and Arabic is the official language of the UAE. The UAE's oil reserves are the seventh-largest in the world while its natural gas reserves are the world's seventeenth-largest. Sheikh Zayed, ruler of Abu Dhabi and the first President of the UAE, oversaw the development of the Emirates and steered oil revenues into healthcare, education and infrastructure. The UAE's economy is the most diversified in the Gulf Cooperation Council, while its most populous city of Dubai is an important global city and an international aviation and maritime trade hub. Consequently the country is much less reliant on oil and gas than in previous years and is economically focusing on tourism and business. The UAE government does not levy income tax although there is a system of corporate tax in place and value added tax was established in 2018 at 5%.The UAE's rising international profile has led to it being recognised as a regional and a middle power.

The landscape is dominated by the Rock of <mask> at the foot of which is a densely populated town area, home to over 30,000 people, primarily <mask>ians.In 1704, Anglo-Dutch forces captured <mask> from <mask> during the War of the Spanish Succession on behalf of the Habsburg claim to the Spanish throne. The territory was ceded to Great Britain in perpetuity under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. During World War II it was an important base for the Royal Navy as it controlled the entrance and exit to the Mediterranean Sea, the Strait of <mask>, which is only 14.3 km (8.9 mi) wide at this naval choke point. It remains strategically important, with half the world's seaborne trade passing through the strait. Today <mask>'s economy is based largely on tourism, online gambling, financial services and cargo ship refuelling.The sovereignty of <mask> is a point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations because <mask> asserts a claim to the territory. <mask>ians rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty in a 1967 referendum and, in a 2002 referendum, the idea of shared sovereignty was also rejected.

Although <mask> is not an ECOWAS member state, it is geographically and historically in West Africa with the Southern <mask>s which now form her Northwest and Southwest Regions having a strong West African history. The country is sometimes identified as West African and other times as Central African due to its strategic position at the crossroads between West and Central Africa.<mask> is home to over 250 native languages spoken by nearly 20 million people. The official languages of <mask> are French and English, the languages of former colonial French <mask>s and British <mask>s. The country is often referred to as "Africa in miniature" for its geological and cultural diversity. Natural features include beaches, deserts, mountains, rainforests, and savannas. The highest point at almost 4,100 metres (13,500 ft) is Mount <mask> in the Southwest Region of the country, and the largest cities in population-terms are Douala on the Wouri river, its economic capital and main seaport, Yaoundé, its political capital, and Garoua. The country is well known for its native styles of music, particularly Makossa and Bikutsi, and for its successful national football team.Early inhabitants of the territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake <mask> and the Baka hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest. Portuguese explorers reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area Rio dos Camarões (Shrimp River), which became <mask> in English. Fulani soldiers founded the Adamawa Emirate in the north in the 19th century, and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and fondoms. <mask> became a German colony in 1884 known as Kamerun.After World War I, the territory was divided between <mask> and the <mask> as League of Nations mandates. The Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) political party advocated independence, but was outlawed by <mask> in the 1950s, leading to the Bamileke War fought between French and UPC militant forces until early 1971. In 1960, the French-administered part of <mask> became independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President Ahmadou Ahidjo. The southern part of British <mask>s federated with it in 1961 to form the Federal Republic of <mask>. The federation was abandoned in 1972. The country was renamed the United Republic of <mask> in 1972 and the Republic of <mask> in 1984. Large numbers of <mask>ians live as subsistence farmers. Since 1982 Paul Biya has been President, governing with his <mask> People's Democratic Movement party. The country has experienced tensions coming from the English-speaking territories. Politicians in the English-speaking regions have advocated for greater decentralisation and even complete separation or independence (as in the Southern <mask>s National Council) from <mask>. In 2017, tensions in the English-speaking territories escalated into open warfare.

It is bordered by <mask> to the north and east and <mask> to the south, while <mask> is west across the Mediterranean Sea. <mask>'s location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity. At just 10,452 km2 (4,036 sq. mi.), it is the smallest recognized sovereign state on the mainland Asian continent.The earliest evidence of civilization in <mask> dates back more than seven thousand years, predating recorded history. <mask> was the home of the Canaanites/Phoenicians and their kingdoms, a maritime culture that flourished for over a thousand years (c. 1550–539 BC). In 64 BC, the region came under the rule of the R<mask> Empire, and eventually became one of the Empire's leading centers of Christianity. In the Mount <mask> range a monastic tradition known as the Maronite Church was established. As the Arab Muslims conquered the region, the Maronites held onto their religion and identity. However, a new religious group, the Druze, established themselves in Mount <mask> as well, generating a religious divide that has lasted for centuries. During the Crusades, the Maronites re-established contact with the R<mask> Catholic Church and asserted their communion with Rome. The ties they established with the Latins have influenced the region into the modern era.The region eventually was ruled by the Ott<mask> Empire from 1516 to 1918. Following the collapse of the empire after World War I, the five provinces that constitute modern <mask> came under the French Mandate of <mask>. The French expanded the borders of the Mount <mask> Governorate, which was mostly populated by Maronites and Druze, to include more Muslims. <mask> gained independence in 1943, establishing confessionalism, a unique, Consociationalism-type of political system with a power-sharing mechanism based on religious communities. Bechara El Khoury, President of <mask> during the independence, Riad El-Solh, first Lebanese prime minister and Emir Majid Arslan II, first Lebanese minister of defence, are considered the founders of the modern Republic of <mask> and are national heroes for having led the country's independence. Foreign troops withdrew completely from <mask> on 31 December 1946, although the country was subjected to military occupations by <mask> that lasted nearly thirty years before being withdrawn in April 2005 as well as the <mask>i military in Southern <mask> for fifteen years.Despite its small size, the country has developed a well-known culture and has been highly influential in the Arab world, powered by its large diaspora. Before the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990), the country experienced a period of relative calm and renowned prosperity, driven by tourism, agriculture, commerce, and banking. Because of its financial power and diversity in its heyday, <mask> was referred to as the "<mask> of the East" during the 1960s, and its capital, Beirut, attracted so many tourists that it was known as "the Paris of the Middle East". At the end of the war, there were extensive efforts to revive the economy and rebuild national infrastructure. In spite of these troubles, <mask> has the 7th highest Human Development Index and GDP per capita in the Arab world after the oil-rich economies of the Persian Gulf. <mask> has been a member of the United Nations since its founding in 1945 as well as of the Arab League (1945), the Non-Aligned Movement (1961), Organisation of the Islamic Cooperation (1969) and the Organisation internationale de la francophonie (1973).
136	<mask> (Māori: Aotearoa [aɔˈtɛaɾɔa]) is a sovereign island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmasses—the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui), and the South Island (Te Waipounamu)—and around 600 smaller islands. <mask> is situated some 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) east of <mask> across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1,000 kilometres (600 mi) south of the Pacific island areas of <mask>, <mask>, and <mask>. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, <mask> developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal, and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. <mask>'s capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.Sometime between 1250 and 1300, Polynesians settled in the islands that later were named <mask> and developed a distinctive Māori culture. In 1642, Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight <mask>. In 1840, representatives of the <mask> and Māori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which declared British sovereignty over the islands. In 1841, <mask> became a colony within the British Empire and in 1907 it became a dominion; it gained full statutory independence in 1947 and the British monarch remained the head of state. Today, the majority of <mask>'s population of 4.9 million is of European descent; the indigenous Māori are the largest minority, followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders. Reflecting this, <mask>'s culture is mainly derived from Māori and early British settlers, with recent broadening arising from increased immigration. The official languages are English, Māori, and NZ Sign Language, with English being very dominant.A developed country, <mask> ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, health, education, protection of civil liberties, and economic freedom. <mask> underwent major economic changes during the 1980s, which transformed it from a protectionist to a liberalised free-trade economy. The service sector dominates the national economy, followed by the industrial sector, and agriculture; international tourism is a significant source of revenue. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet, led by the prime minister, currently Jacinda Ardern. Queen Elizabeth II is the country's monarch and is represented by a governor-general, currently Dame Patsy Reddy.

139	The Democratic <mask> (pronunciation  French: République démocratique du Congo [kɔ̃ɡo]), also known as <mask>, the DRC, DROC, Congo-Kinshasa, East Congo, or simply the Congo, is a country located in Central Africa. It is sometimes anachronistically referred to by its former name of Zaire, which was its official name between 1971 and 1997. It is, by area, the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa, the second-largest in all of Africa (after <mask>), and the 11th-largest in the world. With a population of over 78 million, the Democratic <mask> is the most populous officially Francophone country, the fourth-most-populous country in Africa, and the 16th-most-populous country in the world. Eastern <mask> has been the scene of ongoing military conflict in Kivu, since 2015.Centred on the Congo Basin, the territory of the DRC was first inhabited by Central African foragers around 90,000 years ago and was reached by the Bantu expansion about 3,000 years ago. In the west, the Kingdom of Kongo ruled around the mouth of the Congo River from the 14th to 19th centuries. In the centre and east, the kingdoms of Luba and Lunda ruled from the 16th and 17th centuries to the 19th century. In the 1870s, just before the onset of the Scramble for Africa, European exploration of the Congo Basin was carried out, first led by Henry Morton Stanley under the sponsorship of Leopold II of <mask>. Leopold formally acquired rights to the Congo territory at the Berlin Conference in 1885 and made the land his private property, naming it the Congo Free State. During the Free State, his colonial military unit, the Force Publique, forced the local population to produce rubber. From 1885 to 1908, millions of the Kongo people died as a consequence of disease and exploitation. In 1908, <mask>, despite initial reluctance, formally annexed the Free State, which became known as the Belgian Congo.The Belgian Congo achieved independence on 30 June 1960 under the name <mask>. Congolese nationalist Patrice Lumumba was elected the first Prime Minister, while Joseph Kasa-Vubu became the first President. Conflict arose over the administration of the territory, which became known as the Congo Crisis. The provinces of Katanga, under Moïse Tshombe, and South Kasai attempted to secede. After Lumumba turned to the Soviet Union for assistance in the crisis, the U.S. and <mask> became wary and oversaw his removal from office by Kasa-Vubu on 5 September and ultimate execution by Belgian-led Katangese troops on 17 January 1961. On 25 November 1965, Army Chief of Staff Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, who later renamed himself Mobutu Sese Seko, officially came into power through a coup d'état. In 1971, he renamed the country Zaire. The country was run as a dictatorial one-party state, with his Popular Movement of the Revolution as the sole legal party. Mobutu's government received considerable support from the <mask>, due to its anti-communist stance during the Cold War. By the early 1990s, Mobutu's government began to weaken. Destabilisation in the east resulting from the 1994 <mask>n genocide and disenfranchisement among the eastern Banyamulenge (Congolese Tutsi) population led to a 1996 invasion led by Tutsi FPR-ruled <mask>, which began the First Congo War.On 17 May 1997, Laurent-Désiré Kabila, a leader of Tutsi forces from the province of South Kivu, became President after Mobutu fled to <mask>, reverting the country's name to the Democratic <mask>. Tensions between President Kabila and the <mask>n and Tutsi presence in the country led to the Second Congo War from 1998 to 2003. Ultimately, nine African countries and around twenty armed groups became involved in the war, which resulted in the deaths of 5.4 million people. The two wars devastated the country. President Laurent-Désiré Kabila was assassinated by one of his bodyguards on 16 January 2001 and was succeeded eight days later as President by his son Joseph.The Democratic <mask> is extremely rich in natural resources but has had political instability, a lack of infrastructure, issues with corruption and centuries of both commercial and colonial extraction and exploitation with little holistic development. Besides the capital Kinshasa, the two next largest cities Lubumbashi and Mbuji-Mayi are both mining communities. <mask>'s largest export is raw minerals, with <mask> accepting over 50% of DRC's exports in 2012. In 2016, <mask>'s level of human development was ranked 176th out of 187 countries by the Human Development Index. As of 2018, around 600,000 Congolese have fled to neighbouring countries from conflicts in the centre and east of the DRC.

The first independent monarchy emerged in the 10th century AD, paving the way for successive imperial dynasties as the nation expanded geographically southward until the Indo<mask> Peninsula was colonised by the French in the mid-19th century. Modern <mask>'s age was marked upon the declaration of independence from <mask> in 1945. Following <mask>ese victory against the French in the First Indo<mask> War, which ended in 1954, the nation was divided into two rival states: communist North and anti-communist South.

The most outlying island is Ono-i-Lau. The two major islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, account for 87% of the total population of 898,760. The capital, Suva, on Viti Levu, serves as the country's principal cruise-ship port. About three-quarters of <mask>ans live on Viti Levu's coasts, either in Suva or in smaller urban centres such as Nadi—where tourism is the major local industry—or Lautoka, where the sugar-cane industry is paramount. Due to its terrain, the interior of Viti Levu is sparsely inhabited.The majority of <mask>'s islands formed through volcanic activity starting around 150 million years ago. Some geothermal activity still occurs today, on the islands of Vanua Levu and Taveuni. The geothermal systems on Viti Levu are non-volcanic in origin, with low-temperature (c. 35–60 degrees Celsius) surface discharges. Sabeto Hot Springs near Nadi is a good example. Humans have lived in <mask> since the second millennium BC—first Austronesians and later Melanesians, with some Polynesian influences. Europeans visited <mask> from the 17th century onwards, and, after a brief period as an independent kingdom, the British established the Colony of <mask> in 1874. <mask> operated as a Crown colony until 1970, when it gained independence as the Dominion of <mask>. A military government declared a Republic in 1987 following a series of coups d'état. In a coup in 2006, Commodore Frank Bainimarama seized power.

They eventually settled here. Islands in the archipelago were first explored by Europeans in the 1520s, starting with Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer in the service of <mask>, Juan Sebastián Elcano and Miguel de Saavedra. Spanish explorer Alonso de Salazar reported sighting an atoll in August 1526. Other expeditions by Spanish and English ships followed.

It is known to have numerous groups of uncontacted peoples, and researchers believe there are many undiscovered species of plants and animals in the interior.Papua New <mask> is classified as a developing economy by the International Monetary Fund. Strong growth in Papua New <mask>'s mining and resource sector led to the country becoming the sixth-fastest-growing economy in the world in 2011. Growth was expected to slow once major resource projects came on line in 2015. Mining remains a major economic factor, however. Local and national governments are discussing the potential of resuming mining operations at the Panguna mine in Bougainville Province, which has been closed since the civil war in the 1980s–1990s.

Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution's recognition of 11 official languages, which is the fourth-highest number in the world. Two of these languages are of European origin: Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most coloured and white <mask>ns; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism, and is commonly used in public and commercial life, though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language. The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'état, and regular elections have been held for almost a century. However, the vast majority of black <mask>ns were not enfranchised until 1994. During the 20th century, the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority, with this struggle playing a large role in the country's recent history and politics. The National Party imposed apartheid in 1948, institutionalising previous racial segregation. After a long and sometimes violent struggle by the African National Congress (ANC) and other anti-apartheid activists both inside and outside the country, the repeal of discriminatory laws began in the mid-1980s.Since 1994, all ethnic and linguistic groups have held political representation in the country's liberal democracy, which comprises a parliamentary republic and nine provinces. <mask> is often referred to as the "rainbow nation" to describe the country's multicultural diversity, especially in the wake of apartheid.

Archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved Neolithic village of Khirokitia, and <mask> is home to some of the oldest water wells in the world. <mask> was settled by Mycenaean Greeks in two waves in the 2nd millennium BC. As a strategic location in the Middle East, it was subsequently occupied by several major powers, including the empires of the As<mask>ns, <mask>ians and Persians, from whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great. Subsequent rule by Ptolemaic <mask>, the Classical and Eastern R<mask> Empire, Arab caliphates for a short period, the French Lusignan dynasty and the Venetians, was followed by over three centuries of Ott<mask> rule between 1571 and 1878 (de jure until 1914).<mask> was placed under the UK's administration based on the <mask> Convention in 1878 and was formally annexed by the UK in 1914. While Turkish Cypriots made up 18% of the population, the partition of <mask> and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and <mask> in the 1950s. Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of <mask> to <mask> as <mask> was considered an "extension of Anatolia" by them; while, since the 19th century, the majority Greek Cypriot population and its Orthodox church had been pursuing union with <mask>, which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s. Following nationalist violence in the 1950s, <mask> was granted independence in 1960. The crisis of 1963–64 brought further intercommunal violence between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, which displaced more than 25,000 Turkish Cypriots into enclaves and brought the end of Turkish Cypriot representation in the republic. On 15 July 1974, a coup d'état was staged by Greek Cypriot nationalists and elements of the Greek military junta in an attempt at enosis, the incorporation of <mask> into <mask>. This action precipitated the Turkish invasion of <mask> on 20 July, which led to the capture of the present-day territory of Northern <mask> in the following month, after a ceasefire collapsed, and the displacement of over 150,000 Greek Cypriots and 50,000 Turkish Cypriots. A separate Turkish Cypriot state in the north was established by unilateral declaration in 1983; the move was widely condemned by the international community, with <mask> alone recognizing the new state. These events and the resulting political situation are matters of a continuing dispute.The Republic of <mask> has de jure sovereignty over the entire island, including its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone, with the exception of the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, which remain under the UK's control according to the London and Zürich Agreements. However, the Republic of <mask> is de facto partitioned into two main parts: the area under the effective control of the Republic, located in the south and west and comprising about 59% of the island's area, and the north, administered by the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern <mask>, covering about 36% of the island's area. Another nearly 4% of the island's area is covered by the UN buffer zone.

It is bordered by <mask> to its northeast and <mask> to its north, west and south. At no more than 200 kilometres (120 mi) north to south and 130 kilometres (81 mi) east to west, Eswatini is one of the smallest countries in Africa; despite this, its climate and topography are diverse, ranging from a cool and mountainous highveld to a hot and dry lowveld.The population is primarily ethnic Swazis. The language is Swazi (siSwati in native form). The Swazis established their kingdom in the mid-18th century under the leadership of Ngwane III. The country and the Swazi take their names from Mswati II, the 19th-century king under whose rule Swazi territory was expanded and unified; the present boundaries were drawn up in 1881 in the midst of the Scramble for Africa.

It occupies the eastern five-eighths of the island, which it shares with the nation of <mask>, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with <mask>, that are shared by two sovereign states. The <mask> is the second-largest Caribbean nation by area (after <mask>) at 48,671 square kilometers (18,792 sq mi), and third by population with approximately 10 million people, of whom approximately three million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city.Christopher Columbus landed on the island on December 5, 1492, which the native Taíno people had inhabited since the 7th century. The colony of Santo Domingo became the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas, the oldest continuously inhabited city, and the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World. After more than three hundred years of Spanish rule the <mask>n people declared independence in November 1821. The leader of the independence movement José Núñez de Cáceres, intended the <mask>n nation to unite with the country of Gran <mask>, but no longer under <mask>'s custody the newly independent <mask>ns were forcefully annexed by <mask> in February 1822. Independence came 22 years later after victory in the <mask>n War of Independence in 1844. Over the next 72 years the <mask> experienced mostly internal conflicts and a brief return to colonial status before permanently ousting Spanish rule during the <mask>n War of Restoration of 1863–1865.

In the first half of 2016 the <mask>n economy grew 7.4% continuing its trend of rapid economic growth. Recent growth has been driven by construction, manufacturing, tourism, and mining. The country is the site of the second largest gold mine in the world, the Pueblo Viejo mine. Private consumption has been strong, as a result of low inflation (under 1% on average in 2015), job creation, and a high level of remittances.The <mask> is the most visited destination in the Caribbean.

189	<mask> ( (listen)) or Cabo Verde ( (listen), ) (Portuguese: Cabo Verde, pronounced [ˈkabu ˈveɾdɨ]), officially the Republic of Cabo Verde, is an island country spanning an archipelago of 10 volcanic islands in the central Atlantic Ocean. It forms part of the Macaronesia ecoregion, along with the Azores, Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Savage Isles. In ancient times these islands were referred to as "the Islands of the Blessed" or the "Fortunate Isles". Located 570 kilometres (350 mi) west of the <mask> Peninsula off the coast of Northwest Africa, the islands cover a combined area of slightly over 4,000 square kilometres (1,500 sq mi).The <mask> archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century, when Portuguese explorers discovered and colonized the islands, establishing the first European settlement in the tropics. Ideally located for the Atlantic slave trade, the islands grew prosperous throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, attracting merchants, privateers, and pirates. The end of transatlantic slavery in the 19th century led to economic decline and emigration. <mask> gradually recovered as an important commercial center and stopover for shipping routes. Incorporated as an overseas department of <mask> in 1951, the islands continued to campaign for independence, which was peacefully achieved in 1975.Since the early 1990s, <mask> has been a stable representative democracy, and remains one of the most developed and democratic countries in Africa. Lacking natural resources, its developing economy is mostly service-oriented, with a growing focus on tourism and foreign investment. Its population of around 540,000 is mostly of mixed European, Moorish, Arab and African heritage, and predominantly R<mask> Catholic, reflecting the legacy of Portuguese rule. A sizeable diaspora community exists across the world, slightly outnumbering inhabitants on the islands.Historically, the name "<mask>" has been used in English for the archipelago and, since independence in 1975, for the country. In 2013, the <mask>an government determined that the Portuguese designation Cabo Verde would henceforth be used for official purposes, such as at the United Nations, even in English contexts.  <mask> is a member of the African Union.
190	<mask> (Italian: Italia [iˈtaːlja] (listen)), officially the Italian Republic (Italian: Repubblica Italiana [reˈpubblika itaˈljaːna]), is a European country consisting of a peninsula delimited by the Italian Alps and surrounded by several islands. Located in the middle of the Mediterranean sea and traversed along its length by the Apennines, <mask> has a largely temperate seasonal and Mediterranean climate. The country covers an area of 301,340 km2 (116,350 sq mi) and shares open land borders with <mask>, <mask>, <mask>, <mask> and the enclaved microstates of <mask> and <mask>. <mask> has a territorial exclave in <mask> (Campione) and a maritime exclave in the <mask>n Sea (Lampedusa). With around 60 million inhabitants, <mask> is the fourth-most populous member state of the European Union.Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean, <mask> has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures. In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout modern-day <mask>, the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name, beginning from the classical era, Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular <mask>, Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of southern <mask>, while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern <mask> respectively. An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the R<mask> Kingdom in the 8th century BC, which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People. The R<mask> Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the peninsula, eventually expanding and conquering parts of Europe, North Africa and  Asia. By the first century BC, the R<mask> Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became the leading cultural, political and religious centre of Western civilisation, inaugurating the Pax R<mask>a, a period of more than 200 years during which <mask>'s law, technology, economy, art, and literature developed. <mask> remained the homeland of the R<mask>s and the metropole of the empire, whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture, governments, Christianity and the Latin script.During the Early Middle Ages, <mask> endured sociopolitical collapse and barbarian invasions, but by the 11th century, numerous rival city-states and maritime republics, mainly in the northern and central regions of <mask>, rose to great prosperity through trade, commerce and banking, laying the groundwork for modern capitalism. These mostly independent statelets served as Europe's main trading hubs with Asia and the Near East, often enjoying a greater degree of democracy than the larger feudal monarchies that were consolidating throughout Europe; however, part of central <mask> was under the control of the theocratic Papal States, while Southern <mask> remained largely feudal until the 19th century, partially as a result of a succession of Byzantine, Arab, Norman, Angevin, Aragonese and other foreign conquests of the region. The Renaissance began in <mask> and spread to the rest of Europe, bringing a renewed interest in humanism, science, exploration and art. Italian culture flourished, producing famous scholars, artists and polymaths. During the Middle Ages, Italian explorers discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World, helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery. Nevertheless, <mask>'s commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening of trade routes that bypassed the Mediterranean. Furthermore, centuries of infighting between the Italian city-states, such as the Italian Wars of the 15th and 16th centuries, left the region fragmented, and it was subsequently conquered and further divided by European powers such as <mask>, <mask> and <mask>.By the mid-19th century, rising Italian nationalism and calls for independence from foreign control led to a period of revolutionary political upheaval. After centuries of foreign domination and political division, <mask> was almost entirely unified in 1861, establishing the Kingdom of <mask> as a great power. From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, <mask> rapidly industrialised, namely in the north, and acquired a colonial empire, while the south remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialisation, fuelling a large and influential diaspora. Despite being one of the main victors in World War I, <mask> entered a period of economic crisis and social turmoil, leading to the rise of a fascist dictatorship in 1922. Participation in World War II on the Axis side ended in military defeat, economic destruction and the Italian Civil War. Following the liberation of <mask> and the rise of the resistance, the country abolished the monarchy, established a democratic Republic and enjoyed a prolonged economic boom, becoming a highly developed country.Today, <mask> is considered to be one of the world's most culturally and economically advanced countries, with its economy ranking eighth-largest in the world and third in the Eurozone by nominal GDP. <mask> has the sixth-largest worldwide national wealth, the third-largest central bank gold reserve, and a very high life expectancy. The country plays a prominent role in regional and global economic, military, cultural and diplomatic affairs; it is both a regional power and a great power, and is ranked the world's eighth most-powerful military. <mask> is a founding and leading member of the European Union and a member of numerous international institutions, including the UN, NATO, the OECD, the OSCE, the WTO, the G7, the G20, the Union for the Mediterranean, the Council of Europe, Uniting for Consensus, the Schengen Area and many more. The country have greatly influenced and contributed to diverse fields, notably the arts, music, literature, philosophy, science and technology, fashion, cinema, cuisine, sports, as well as jurisprudence, banking and business. As a reflection of its cultural wealth, <mask> is home to the world's largest number of World Heritage Sites (54), and is the fifth-most visited country.

East Thrace, located in Europe, is separated from Anatolia by the Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorous strait and the Dardanelles (collectively called the Turkish Straits). <mask> is bordered by <mask> and <mask> to its northwest; <mask> to its northeast; <mask>, the <mask>i exclave of Nakhchivan and <mask> to the east; and <mask> and <mask> to the south. Istanbul is the largest city, but more central Ankara is the capital. Approximately 70 to 80 per cent of the country's citizens identify as Turkish. Kurds are the largest minority; the size of the Kurdish population is a subject of dispute with estimates placing the figure at anywhere from 12 to 25 per cent of the population.At various points in its history, the region has been inhabited by diverse civilizations including the As<mask>ns, Greeks, Thracians, Phrygians, Urartians, and <mask>ns. Hellenization started during the era of Alexander the Great and continued into the Byzantine era. The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century, and their victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 symbolizes the start and foundation of <mask>. The Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, when it disintegrated into small Turkish principalities. Beginning in the late 13th-century, the Ott<mask>s started uniting these Turkish principalities. After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople in 1453, Ott<mask> expansion continued under Selim I. During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the Ott<mask> Empire encompassed much of Southeast Europe, West Asia and North Africa and became a world power. In the following centuries the state entered a period of decline with a gradual loss of territories and wars. In an effort to consolidate the weakening social and political foundations of the empire, Mahmut II started a period of modernisation in the early 19th century, bringing reforms in all areas of the state including the military and bureaucracy along with the emancipation of all citizens.In 1913, a coup d'état effectively put the country under the control of the Three Pashas. During World War I, the Ott<mask> government committed genocides against its <mask>n, As<mask>n and Pontic Greek subjects. Following the war, the conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ott<mask> Empire was partitioned into several new states. The Turkish War of Independence, initiated by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his colleagues against occupying Allied Powers, resulted in the abolition of monarchy in 1922 and the establishment of the Republic of <mask> in 1923, with Atatürk as its first president. Atatürk enacted numerous reforms, many of which incorporated various aspects of Western thought, philosophy, and customs into the new form of Turkish government. The Kurdish–Turkish conflict, an armed conflict between the Republic of <mask> and Kurdish insurgents, has been active since 1984 primarily in the southeast of the country. Various Kurdish groups demand separation from <mask> to create an independent Kurdistan or to have autonomy and greater political and cultural rights for Kurds in <mask>.<mask> is a charter member of the UN, an early member of NATO, the IMF and the World Bank, and a founding member of the OECD, OSCE, BSEC, OIC and G-20.

Prague was the imperial seat in periods between the 14th and 17th century. The Protestant Bohemian Reformation of the 15th century led to the Hussite Wars, the first of many conflicts with the Catholic Church.Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg Monarchy. The Protestant Bohemian Revolt (1618–20) against the Catholic Habsburgs led to the Thirty Years' War. After the Battle of the White Mountain, the Habsburgs consolidated their rule, eradicated Protestantism, reimposed Catholicism, and adopted a policy of gradual Germanization. This contributed to anti-Habsburg sentiment and resentment of the Catholic Church that continues to this day. With the dissolution of the Holy R<mask> Empire in 1806, the Bohemian Kingdom became part of the <mask>n Empire (1804 to 1867) and the Czech language experienced a revival as a consequence of widespread r<mask>tic nationalism. In the 19th century, the Czech lands became the industrial powerhouse of the monarchy and were subsequently the core of the Republic of Czecho<mask>, which was formed in 1918 following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I.Czecho<mask> was the only democracy in Central Europe during the interwar period.

Increasing dissatisfaction with the regime culminated in 1968 to the reform movement known as the Prague Spring, which ended in a Soviet-led invasion. Czecho<mask> remained occupied until the 1989 Velvet Revolution, which peacefully ended communist rule and reestablished democracy and a market economy. On 1 January 1993, Czecho<mask> peacefully dissolved, with its constituent states becoming the independent states of the Czech Republic and <mask>.

The African enclaves of Ceuta, Melilla, and Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera make <mask> the only European country to have a physical border with an African country (<mask>). Several small islands in the Alboran Sea are also part of Spanish territory.

By population, <mask> is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union. <mask>'s capital and largest city is Madrid; other major urban areas include Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Málaga and Bilbao.Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago. Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician, Greek, Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under R<mask> rule around 200 BCE, after which the region was named Hispania, based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp(a)n or Spania. At the end of the Western R<mask> Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe, invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces, including the Suebi, Alans and Vandals. Eventually, the Visigoths would forcibly integrate all remaining independent territories in the peninsula, including Byzantine provinces, into the Kingdom of Toledo, which more or less unified politically, ecclesiastically and legally all the former R<mask> provinces or successor kingdoms of what was then documented as Hispania.In the early eighth century the Visigothic Kingdom fell to the Moors of the Umayyad Islamic Caliphate, who arrived to rule most of the peninsula in the year 726, leaving only a handful of small Christian realms in the north and lasting up to seven centuries in the Kingdom of Granada. This led to many wars during a long reconquering period across the Iberian Peninsula, which led to the creation of Kingdom of Leon, Kingdom of Castille, Kingdom of Aragon and Kingdom of Navarre as the main Christian kingdoms to face the invasion. Following the Moorish conquest, Europeans began a gradual process of retaking the region known as the Reconquista, which by the late 15th century culminated in the emergence of <mask> as a unified country under the Catholic Monarchs.In the early modern period, <mask> became the world's first global empire and the most powerful country in the world, leaving a large cultural and linguistic legacy that includes +570 million Hispanophones, making Spanish the world's second-most spoken native language, after Mandarin Chinese.

It is also the world's second-largest landlocked country behind <mask> and the largest landlocked country that does not border a closed sea. The country contains very little arable land, as much of its area is covered by grassy steppe, with mountains to the north and west and the Gobi Desert to the south. Ulaanbaatar, the capital and largest city, is home to about 45% of the country's population. Ulaanbaatar also shares the rank of the world's coldest capital city with Moscow, Ottawa, and Nur-Sultan.Approximately 30% of the population is nomadic or semi-nomadic; horse culture is still integral.

Various <mask>nised kingdoms such as the Mon, the Khmer Empire and Malay states ruled the region, competing with Thai states such as Ngoenyang, the Sukhothai Kingdom, Lan Na and the Ayutthaya Kingdom, which rivaled each other. Documented European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya, one of the great powers in the region. Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan Narai's reign (1656–88), gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in 1767 in a war with Burma. Taksin (r. 1767–82) quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived Thonburi Kingdom. He was succeeded in 1782 by Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke (r. 1782–1809), the first monarch of the Chakri dynasty and founder of the Rattanakosin Kingdom, which lasted into the early 20th century.Through the 18th and 19th centuries, Siam faced pressure from <mask> and the <mask>, including forced concessions of territory; nevertheless, it remained the only Southeast Asian country to avoid direct Western rule.

The capital and largest urban agglomeration is the city of Caracas. It has a territorial extension of 916,445 km2 (353,841 sq mi). The continental territory is bordered on the north by the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by <mask>, <mask> on the south, <mask> to the north-east and on the east by <mask>.

This marine area borders those of 13 states. The country has extremely high biodiversity and is ranked seventh in the world's list of nations with the most number of species. There are habitats ranging from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon basin rain-forest in the south via extensive llanos plains, the Caribbean coast and the Orinoco River Delta in the east.The sovereign state is a federal presidential republic consisting of 23 states, the Capital District (covering Caracas), and federal dependencies (covering <mask>'s offshore islands). <mask> also claims all Guyanese territory west of the Essequibo River, a 159,500-square-kilometre (61,583 sq mi) tract dubbed Guayana Esequiba or the Zona en Reclamación (the "zone under dispute"). <mask> is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of <mask>ns live in the cities of the north, especially in the capital (Caracas) which is also the largest city in <mask>.The territory now known as <mask> was colonized by <mask> in 1522 amid resistance from indigenous peoples. In 1811, it became one of the first Spanish-American territories to declare independence, which was not securely established until 1821, when <mask> was a department of the federal republic of Gran <mask>. It gained full independence as a country in 1830. During the 19th century, <mask> suffered political turmoil and autocracy, remaining dominated by regional caudillos (military strongmen) until the mid-20th century. Since 1958, the country has had a series of democratic governments. Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to several political crises, including the deadly Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and the impeachment of President Carlos Andrés Pérez for embezzlement of public funds in 1993. A collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 election of former coup-involved career officer Hugo Chávez and the launch of the Bolivarian Revolution.  The revolution began with a 1999 Constituent Assembly, where a new Constitution of <mask> was written. This new constitution officially changed the name of the country to Bolivarian Republic of <mask> (Spanish: República Bolivariana de <mask>).Oil was discovered in the early 20th century, and today, <mask> has the world's largest known oil reserves and has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil. Previously, the country was an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and cocoa, but oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. The 1980s oil glut led to an external debt crisis and a long-running economic crisis. Inflation peaked at 100% in 1996 and poverty rates rose to 66% in 1995 as (by 1998) per capita GDP fell to the same level as 1963, down a third from its 1978 peak. The recovery of oil prices in the early 2000s gave <mask> oil funds not seen since the 1980s. The <mask>n government under Hugo Chávez then established populist social welfare policies that initially boosted the <mask>n economy and increased social spending, temporarily reducing economic inequality and poverty in the early years of the regime. In 2013, Hugo Chávez died, shortly after being elected to a fourth term, and was succeeded by Nicolás Maduro, elected by a narrow majority in a widely disputed election. Maduro continued the populist policies of Chávez, but with disastrous results. The nation's economy collapsed because of their excesses—including a uniquely extreme fossil fuel subsidy—and are widely blamed for destabilizing the nation's economy. The destabilized economy led to a crisis in <mask>, resulting in hyperinflation, an economic depression, shortages of basic goods and drastic increases in unemployment, poverty, disease, child mortality, malnutrition and crime. These factors have precipitated the <mask>n migrant crisis where more than three million people have fled the country. By 2017, <mask> was declared to be in default regarding debt payments by credit rating agencies. In 2018, the country's economic policies led to extreme hyperinflation, with estimates expecting an inflation rate of 1,370,000% by the end of the year and 10,000,000% in 2019.<mask> is a charter member of the UN, OAS, UNASUR, ALBA, Mercosur, LAIA and OEI.

One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day <mask> was the Neolithic Karanovo culture, which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for Thracians, Persians, Celts and ancient <mask>ns; stability came when the R<mask> Empire conquered the region in AD 45. The Eastern R<mask>, or Byzantine, Empire lost some of these territories to an invading Bulgar horde in the late 7th century. The Bulgars founded the First <mask>n Empire in AD 681, which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script. This state lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it. A successful <mask>n revolt in 1185 established a Second <mask>n Empire, which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II (1218–1241). After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the Second <mask>n Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under Ott<mask> rule for nearly five centuries.The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 resulted in the formation of the current Third <mask>n State.

Its continental European territory is situated on the Iberian Peninsula. Its territory also includes two archipelagoes: the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa, and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea. The African enclaves of Ceuta, Melilla, and Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera make <mask> the only European country to have a physical border with an African country (<mask>). Several small islands in the Alboran Sea are also part of Spanish territory. The country's mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with <mask>; to the north and northeast by <mask>, <mask>, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by <mask> and the Atlantic Ocean.With an area of 505,990 km2 (195,360 sq mi), <mask> is the largest country in Southern Europe, the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union, and the fourth largest country in the European continent. By population, <mask> is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union. <mask>'s capital and largest city is Madrid; other major urban areas include Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Málaga and Bilbao.Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago. Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician, Greek, Celtic and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under R<mask> rule around 200 BCE, after which the region was named Hispania, based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp(a)n or Spania. At the end of the Western R<mask> Empire the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe, invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces, including the Suebi, Alans and Vandals. Eventually, the Visigoths would forcibly integrate all remaining independent territories in the peninsula, including Byzantine provinces, into the Kingdom of Toledo, which more or less unified politically, ecclesiastically and legally all the former R<mask> provinces or successor kingdoms of what was then documented as Hispania.In the early eighth century the Visigothic Kingdom fell to the Moors of the Umayyad Islamic Caliphate, who arrived to rule most of the peninsula in the year 726, leaving only a handful of small Christian realms in the north and lasting up to seven centuries in the Kingdom of Granada. This led to many wars during a long reconquering period across the Iberian Peninsula, which led to the creation of Kingdom of Leon, Kingdom of Castille, Kingdom of Aragon and Kingdom of Navarre as the main Christian kingdoms to face the invasion. Following the Moorish conquest, Europeans began a gradual process of retaking the region known as the Reconquista, which by the late 15th century culminated in the emergence of <mask> as a unified country under the Catholic Monarchs.In the early modern period, <mask> became the world's first global empire and the most powerful country in the world, leaving a large cultural and linguistic legacy that includes +570 million Hispanophones, making Spanish the world's second-most spoken native language, after Mandarin Chinese.
